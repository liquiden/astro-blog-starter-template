Astro is redefining how developers build static websites. With its ability to render only what's needed and ship zero JavaScript by default, it's an ideal choice for performance-focused websites like blogs, portfolios, and documentation.

## Why Astro?

Astro allows you to:

- Use any UI framework (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.)
- Deliver lightning-fast performance
- Write in a component-based structure
- Use Markdown and MDX seamlessly

## Getting Started

To create a new project:

```bash
npm create astro@latest
