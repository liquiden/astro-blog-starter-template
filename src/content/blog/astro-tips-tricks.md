If you're new to Astro or want to make your site more efficient, here are 5 quick wins:

1. **Use Content Collections**: Validate and structure your content like a pro.
2. **Islands Architecture**: Load only interactive components, not the whole app.
3. **MDX for Flexibility**: Combine Markdown with React or other frameworks.
4. **Image Optimization**: Use Astro's built-in `<Image>` component.
5. **Zero JS Default**: Don't ship what you don't use. Optimize always.
